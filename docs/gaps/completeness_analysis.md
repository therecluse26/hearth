# Completeness Analysis — Hearth
_Generated: 2026-05-06 · Spec source: docs/specs/ + docs/vision/VISION.md · Code rev: a7c028d · Updated: 2026-05-07_

## Summary

- **Phase 0 (Foundation):** 148/148 test scenarios passing. Core engine is solid.
- **Phase 1 (Production Single-Node):** ~95% complete. P0 gaps closing.
- **Phase 2 (Clustering):** Not started. Entire `src/cluster/` is a stub.

### ~~Top 5 Production Blockers~~ (2 resolved, 3 remain)

1. **~~Encryption at rest~~** — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-05-06).

2. **~~Audit logging is not wired~~** — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-05-07). `EmbeddedIdentityEngine` now holds `Arc<dyn AuditEngine>`. 47 mutation methods emit audit events (`src/identity/engine.rs`). Failure policy: `FailOperation` for destructive mutations (delete, credential change, session revoke, consent revoke), `LogOnly` for non-destructive. `AuditContext { actor: Actor, metadata }` type in `src/audit/context.rs`. 3 redundant protocol-layer audit calls removed (consent grant, consent revoke, session self-revoke). Follow-up: metadata-threading for remaining protocol-layer audit sites (4 federation + 1 SAML + registration IP).

3. **No periodic cleanup** — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-05-08). Background `tokio::spawn` task runs `sweep_expired()` on a configurable interval (default 300s). Sweeps expired authorization codes (`oauth:code:`), device codes (`oauth:device:` + `oauth:ucode:`), pending authorization tickets (`oauth:pending_auth:`), and grant families (`oauth:family:`). Grant families carry a new `expires_at` field (extended on rotation, sliding). Best-effort per-entity-type error handling. Summary `AuditAction::Cleanup` audit event emitted per realm per sweep. `IdentityConfig.cleanup` (enabled, interval_secs, max_per_type).

4. **~~Hot tier auto-sizing missing~~** — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-05-08). Capacity now auto-sizes from `/proc/meminfo` `MemAvailable`, cgroup v2 `memory.max`, or cgroup v1 `memory.limit_in_bytes` (with sentinel detection). Reserves margin (`max(20%, 2 GiB)`) and converts bytes to entries via estimated `ESTIMATED_BYTES_PER_HOT_ENTRY = 1024`. `hot_tier_capacity` in YAML is now `Option<usize>` (`None` = auto-size). `hot_tier_max_memory` provides an explicit memory budget override. `StorageConfig::production()` constructor wires the full `[storage]` YAML section — fixing a latent bug where `StorageConfig::dev()` was used even in production mode, ignoring all storage settings.

5. **Background compaction** — `sst.rs:381` — `compact()` exists but never called automatically. SSTs accumulate.

6. **Token size cap enforcement** — AUTHZ §2.6, §5.4 — Error variant exists but no `validate_token_size()` function.

### What IS Working Well

- **Storage**: WAL with fsync, atomic batch writes, memtable with lock-free reads, SST format + compaction logic, clock-based LRU tiering — all passing unit/property/simulation tests.
- **RBAC**: Complete engine with roles, groups, assignments, transitive resolution, cycle detection, scope filtering, seed data, YAML reconciliation.
- **Identity**: User CRUD, Argon2id + multi-algo verification + upgrade-on-login, session management with enumeration resistance, JWT/Ed25519 + JWKS, realm management with cascading delete, full OAuth 2.0 (all grant types), WebAuthn/Passkeys, TOTP/MFA, magic links, organizations, SAML 2.0, federation.
- **Protocol**: OIDC, REST Admin API, comprehensive web UI (~70 templates), SCIM 2.0, gRPC admin services, SAML SP/IdP endpoints.
- **Tests**: All 148 Phase 0 scenarios pass. 55+ integration test files. 9 benchmarks. 7 fuzz targets. 10 simulation tests.

## Critical P0 Gaps (Must Fix Before Production)

| # | Gap | Spec | Evidence |
|---|-----|------|----------|
| 1 | **Encryption at rest** | ARCH §6.3 | ✅ RESOLVED. Envelope encryption (AES-256-GCM) implemented in `src/storage/`. Per-file DEKs wrapped by per-realm KEKs. Host key from `HEARTH_MASTER_KEY` env var or auto-generated. SST and WAL fully encrypted. |
| 2 | **Audit engine not wired** | ARCH §8.5 | `src/identity/engine.rs` has zero `audit::` references. `EmbeddedIdentityEngine` holds no `Arc<dyn AuditEngine>`. |
| 3 | **No periodic cleanup** | — | **✅ RESOLVED (2026-05-08).** Background `tokio::spawn` task runs `sweep_expired()` on a configurable interval (default 300s). Sweeps expired authorization codes (`oauth:code:`), device codes (`oauth:device:` + `oauth:ucode:`), pending authorization tickets (`oauth:pending_auth:`), and grant families (`oauth:family:`). Grant families carry a new `expires_at` field (extended on rotation, sliding). Best-effort per-entity-type error handling. Summary `AuditAction::Cleanup` audit event emitted per realm per sweep. `IdentityConfig.cleanup` (enabled, interval_secs, max_per_type). |
| 4 | **Hot tier auto-sizing** | ARCH §6.2 | ✅ RESOLVED (2026-05-08). Auto-sizing via /proc/meminfo + cgroup v1/v2. Margin: max(20%, 2 GiB). hot_tier_capacity is now Option<usize>. hot_tier_max_memory override. StorageConfig::production() wires the full storage section. |
| 5 | **Background compaction** | — | `sst.rs:381` — `compact()` exists but never called automatically. SSTs accumulate. |
| 6 | **Token size cap enforcement** | AUTHZ §2.6, §5.4 | Error variant exists but no `validate_token_size()` function. |
| 7 | **`/admin/users/{id}/effective-permissions` REST endpoint** | AUTHZ §8.2 | No route in `src/protocol/http.rs`. Only available via gRPC/UI. |
| 8 | **Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591)** | AGENT_AUTH §2.7 | No `POST /register` endpoint. |
| 9 | **Resolve-time cycle detection** | AUTHZ §3 | `resolve.rs:505` treats DAG cycles as diamonds (silent skip), not errors. Only self-edges error. |

## Important P1 Gaps

| # | Gap | Detail |
|---|-----|--------|
| 10 | **Audience-scoped scope resolution** | `resolve_with_scopes` doesn't accept `resource: Option<Uri>`. Protected-resource scope precedence not implemented. |
| 11 | **User.attributes on create/import requests** | Field exists on `User` struct but `CreateUserRequest`/`ImportUserRequest` don't expose it. |
| 12 | **ArcSwap registry hot-swap not wired** | `PermissionRegistry` exists but SIGHUP reload in `main.rs` not wired. |
| 13 | **Missing OIDC default claim mappings** | `default_claim_profile()` only emits `email`/`name`. Missing `given_name`, `family_name`, `picture`, `locale`, `zoneinfo`, `phone_number`, `address`. |
| 14 | **Config structure: flat vs nested `rbac:`** | Spec says `realms.<id>.rbac.*`, implementation has flat fields on `RealmConfig`. |
| 15 | **No YAML-declared groups** | Groups are runtime-API only; no `groups` field in `RealmYamlConfig`. |
| 16 | **`list_groups`/`list_role_members` cursor unused** | Cursor parameter accepted but never used; `next_cursor` never set. |
| 17 | **`list_roles` cursor derivation flawed** | Captures last item's name from already-built list, not boundary entry. |
| 18 | **RESERVED_PREFIX: `system.` vs `hearth.`** | Code uses `"system."`, spec says `hearth.*`. |
| 19 | **No standalone WebAuthn REST API** | Passkey ceremonies browser-session only. |
| 20 | **Only 2 of 8 SDKs exist** | TypeScript and Go implemented. Python, Rust, Java, PHP, C#, Ruby, Elixir missing. |
| 21 | **Only 2 of 6 migration tools exist** | Keycloak and Auth0 implemented. Clerk, Cognito, Firebase Auth, Okta missing. |
| 22 | **No shadow mode** | Required for zero-downtime migration per VISION.md §5.5. |

## P2 Gaps (Polish)

| # | Gap | Detail |
|---|-----|--------|
| 23 | **Per-realm auth policies not enforced** | Password complexity, MFA required, allowed auth methods, rate limits, token TTLs populated from YAML into `RealmConfig` but never enforced in login/credential flows. |
| 24 | **No Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint** | ARCH §14.2 requires Prometheus-compatible metrics. |
| 25 | **No OpenTelemetry distributed tracing** | ARCH §14.3. No tracing integration exists. |
| 26 | **No Helm chart or systemd service file** | VISION §10 Phase 2. |
| 27 | **No comprehensive README** | THINGS_WE_NEED.md. |
| 28 | **No example sites** | THINGS_WE_NEED.md requires SPAs for every SDK. |
| 29 | **No comprehensive SDK READMEs** | THINGS_WE_NEED.md. |
| 30 | **UI audit P1 items unresolved** | P1-6 (silent realm redirect), P1-9 (admin-user route conflated), P1-10 (pagination unverified), P1-3 (invite form structure). |
| 31 | **UI audit P2 items unresolved** | Breadcrumb self-link, pagination breadcrumb, reset confirmation, syntax highlighting, RBAC autocomplete. |
| 32 | **Roles UI redesign not implemented** | ROLES_UI_REDESIGN.md — inline add member, dropdown-on-change, confirm-remove, resolver links. |
| 33 | **TEST_SCENARIOS.md RBAC checkboxes stale** | Phase 0 Authorization Engine (lines 258-291) and Phase 1 RBAC Authorization Full (lines 599-624) still show `[ ]` despite 15+ passing test files. |
| 34 | **TESTING.md §8 benchmark list outdated** | Missing `oidc_exchange`, `oauth`, `tiered_storage`, `admin`, `audit`; `permission_check` renamed to `rbac_check`; `token_issuance` merged into `token_validation`. |
| 35 | **Embedded mode support contradiction** | VISION.md §6.2 describes embedded mode as supported. ARCHITECTURE.md Appendix says "not supported — FFI tax unjustified". |
| 36 | **`email_verified` claim not computed** | Spec shows `email_verified` as supported. User struct has no `email_verified` bool — must be computed as `status != PendingVerification`. |

---

## Clustering: Entirely Unimplemented

Phase 2 (clustering) has not started. The `src/cluster/` directory is a stub. This means:
- No Raft consensus
- No log replication
- No leader election
- No automatic failover
- No online membership changes
- No snapshot-based recovery
- No multi-region replication

The system is single-node only. This is acceptable for Phase 1 but blocks v1.0 production-ready declaration.

---

## Spec/Code Divergences

| # | Issue | Spec Says | Code Does | Recommendation |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| D1 | RBAC config nesting | `realms.<id>.rbac.{permissions,roles,scopes,groups}` | Flat fields on `RealmConfig` | Update spec to match code (simpler) or nest config |
| D2 | Reserved prefix | `hearth.*` | `system.` constant in `types.rs:21` | Align code to spec: change to `"hearth."` |
| D3 | Embedded mode support | VISION.md says supported; ARCHITECTURE.md appendix says not supported | Not implemented | Remove embedded-mode from VISION.md or update ARCHITECTURE.md |
| D4 | `email_verified` claim | Spec shows it as supported | `User.email_verified` not a field | Compute from `UserStatus` (`status != PendingVerification`) |

## Recommended Execution Order

1. **Encryption at rest** (L, 2-3 weeks) — envelope encryption in SST format first, then WAL, then per-realm keys with rotation
2. **Wire audit logging** (M, 3-5 days) — add `Arc<dyn AuditEngine>` to `EmbeddedIdentityEngine`, call at all mutation sites
3. **Periodic cleanup** (S, 1-2 days) — background task sweeping expired codes/tokens/tickets
4. **Hot tier auto-sizing + background compaction** (M, 3-5 days) — memory detection + compaction loop
5. **Token size cap enforcement** (S, <1 day) — add `validate_token_size()` and call in `issue_tokens_with_context`
6. **P1 fixes** (2-3 weeks total) — most are small (<1 day each); audience-scoped scope resolution and DCR are the largest
7. **P2 polish** (variable) — enforce per-realm policies, add metrics, fix UI issues, update docs
8. **Phase 2 (clustering)** — the largest remaining greenfield work; needs scoping and estimation
