Hearth has not yet cut a versioned release; all shipped work appears under `[Unreleased]`.

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **Go SDK** — minimum Go version bumped from 1.23 to 1.24, clearing `SNYK-GOLANG-STDNETHTTP-16535158` (infinite loop in `std/net/http`) (HEA-515).
- **Admin settings editor** — prototype-pollution guard strengthened in `setVal`: redundant point-of-use check on the final key segment added so static analysis can locally verify safety (HEA-515).
- **Kotlin SDK — Spring Boot BOM** upgraded from 3.3.5 to 3.4.13 (resolves transitive CVEs in Spring Framework, Tomcat, and related dependencies) (HEA-515).
- **Kotlin SDK — nimbus-jose-jwt** upgraded from 9.40 to 9.41.2 (patches JWT library CVEs) (HEA-515).
- **SAML example — xmldom** replaced abandoned `xmldom ^0.6.0` (7 critical CVEs, no upstream fix) with maintained fork `@xmldom/xmldom ^0.9.10` (HEA-515).

### Added

- **Storage engine** — custom embedded WAL + memtable + SST storage engine with tiered hot/cold storage, crash-safe `fsync`-before-ack semantics, per-realm key prefix scoping, and background SST compaction via atomic rename.
- **Hot-path latency targets** — `benches/storage_gate.rs` CI gate enforces p50/p99 read latency; hot-tier auto-sizes from system memory / cgroup limits at startup.
- **Encryption at rest** — all stored realm data encrypted; configurable key material per deployment.
- **Identity layer** — users, hashed credentials (Argon2id), sessions, per-realm signing keys (Ed25519, PKCS#8 persisted), and full cascading delete across 11 key prefixes.
- **Multi-tenancy** — first-class `RealmId` newtype; each realm gets an isolated keyspace, its own signing key, and independent configuration. System realm (`RealmId::nil()`) stores realm metadata.
- **Per-realm branding and config** — stored email template config, locale variables, and web branding wired into login templates.
- **JWT issuance** — Ed25519-signed JWTs with `jti` claim for uniqueness, `iss`/`aud`/`exp` validation per RFC 7519.
- **OIDC Discovery** — `/.well-known/openid-configuration` document; `RS256 + ES256` keys published at `/certs`; document extended with `userinfo_endpoint`, `response_modes_supported`, `claims_supported`, `registration_endpoint`, `device_authorization_endpoint`, `revocation_endpoint`, `introspection_endpoint`, and `grant_types_supported`.
- **OAuth 2.0 complete** — authorization code flow, authorization code with PKCE, client credentials, device authorization (RFC 8628), refresh token rotation with theft detection via grant families, token revocation (RFC 7009), token introspection (RFC 7662). Introspection benchmark: ~1 µs.
- **RFC 8707 resource indicators** — threaded through token issuance and refresh.
- **Dynamic Client Registration** — RFC 7591 register + RFC 7592 read/update at `POST /register`.
- **OIDC Conformance** — Core 1.0 required claims, Discovery 1.0 metadata, UserInfo endpoint with scope-filtered claims, nonce round-trip (stored in auth code → echoed in ID token), and `iss` claim sourced from `config.oidc.issuer` to match discovery document.
- **OIDC RP-initiated logout** — with backchannel and front-channel fan-out to registered clients.
- **TOTP / MFA** — TOTP enrollment and validation (RFC 6238), time-window tolerance, recovery code generation and single-use redemption, brute-force lockout, replay protection. Per-realm `mfa_required` policy enforced at login.
- **WebAuthn / Passkeys** — full Level 2 ceremony: registration, authentication, multi-credential, resident keys, CBOR/authenticator-data parsing, counter-replay protection, RP ID mismatch rejection, and tampered `clientDataJSON` rejection.
- **Magic link / Passwordless** — single-use tokens with configurable TTL, rate limiting, enumeration resistance, and automatic account creation for unknown emails.
- **TLS termination** — PEM loading, live certificate hot-reload without restart, TLS 1.3 enforcement, weak cipher rejection, HTTP → HTTPS redirect, and mutual TLS (mTLS) support.
- **Claims-based RBAC** — replaced Zanzibar with an embedded RBAC engine: roles, groups, and permissions resolved at token issuance and embedded as `roles`/`groups`/`permissions` JWT claims. `GET /v1/me/permissions` effective-permissions endpoint. RBAC cycle detection, reserved namespace guards, and token-size cap. Admin HTTP (`/admin/roles`, `/admin/groups`) and gRPC (`RbacAdminService`) surfaces.
- **Organizations** — B2B customer groups within realms: full CRUD, membership lifecycle (invite → accept → remove), SHA-256 hashed invitation tokens with 7-day expiry, last-owner protection, cascading delete (memberships + invitations + indexes), and slug uniqueness validation.
- **Keycloak migration** — `hearth migrate keycloak --file <export.json>` CLI subcommand. Anti-corruption layer converts Keycloak's nested-JSON credential format to standard PHC strings. Native PBKDF2-SHA256 / PBKDF2-SHA512 verification; upgrades to Argon2id on next password change. `--dry-run` flag. Bypasses HTTP body limits for large exports.
- **Production email service** — five transports: Log (dev), SMTP, SendGrid, Postmark, Mailgun (with EU region). `EmailService` orchestration with per-realm branding override and Askama/Tera HTML + plaintext templates for verification and setup flows.
- **UI theming system** — six named themes: `ember` (dark default), `ocean`, `midnight`, `forest`, `cloud` (light), `slate` (light). Semantic `ht-*` Tailwind tokens backed by CSS custom properties. Global `branding.theme` / `branding.custom_css`; per-realm `web.{theme,custom_css}`. Routes: `GET /ui/static/theme.css` and `GET /ui/static/realm-theme/{id}`.
- **Admin web UI** — server-rendered Axum/Askama templates for users, realms, applications, organizations, groups, roles, permissions, scopes, identity providers, and audit log. Path-based realm scoping. Edit/delete disabled for YAML-managed applications.
- **Admin API** — CRUD endpoints for users, realms, and applications; pagination; bulk operations; full audit trail. `PUT → PATCH` on `/admin/users/{id}`; granular scope decisions; field filters.
- **SCIM provisioning** — user and group sync, service provider config endpoint, realm reconciliation, and per-handler auth enforcement.
- **Signed webhook subscriptions** — HMAC-signed delivery for auth and admin events; subscription management API.
- **Per-realm auth policy enforcement** — `allowed_auth_methods` checked at login; `AuthMethodNotAllowed` error returned when the method is disabled for the realm.
- **Configurable password-reset token TTL** — per-realm override for reset token lifetime.
- **Periodic cleanup** — background task evicts expired OAuth entities (device codes, grant families, revoked JTIs).
- **OpenTelemetry distributed tracing** — trace context propagated through identity and protocol layers.
- **Observability endpoints** — Prometheus `/metrics` (config-gated), `/healthz`, and `/readyz` with fault-injection test coverage.
- **TypeScript SDK** — `createHearth()` factory, `HearthProvider` React context, `useHasPermission` / `useHasRole` / `useInGroup` / `useInOrg` hooks, JWKS validation, and admin CRUD helpers.
- **Go SDK** — auth code flow client, admin CRUD, transparent token refresh, and `HasPermission` / `HasRole` / `InGroup` / `InOrg` / `Permissions` helpers.
- **Kotlin / JVM SDK** — `hearth-core` library and Spring Boot starter (`hearth-spring-boot-starter`).
- **Node.js SDK** — unified `HearthClient` entry point (HEA-366).
- **SDK common specification** — `docs/sdk/SPEC.md` documents the cross-language contract; all SDK READMEs link it. CI spec-conformance checks added for TypeScript and Go.
- **Deployment artifacts** — Helm chart templates, `systemd` unit file, and `docker-compose` configuration.
- **Security Phase A** — PKCE mandatory for all public clients, redirect URI exact-match hardening, RFC 9207 `iss` parameter in all authorization responses; fuzz harnesses for token-exchange and redirect-URI validation paths (HEA-501 / HEA-503).
- **SECURITY.md** — vulnerability disclosure policy and reporting contacts.
- **OpenSSF Scorecard** — CI workflow scoring supply-chain hygiene; `CODEOWNERS` enforces review requirements.
- **Dependabot and Snyk** — automated dependency vulnerability scanning for GitHub Actions and Rust crates.
- **`cargo-audit` config** — integrated into `make check`; one known advisory (`RUSTSEC-2023-0071`, RSA, no active decrypt path) documented and ignored.
- **Rust CI quality-gate workflow** — `clippy --all-targets -D warnings`, `rustfmt --check`, `cargo nextest`, and CSS staleness check (`make css-check`) run on every PR.
- **Storage hot-path benchmark CI gate** — enforces `p50 < 50 µs` / `p99 < 200 µs` on `validate_token` / `lookup_session` / `lookup_user`.
- **`make setup`** — installs repo-managed git hooks (`.githooks/`) including pre-commit CSS and proto auto-regeneration.
- **User guides** — `docs/guides/` tree: getting-started, RBAC, SCIM provisioning, webhooks, organizations, and deployment.
- **Operator runbooks** — RBAC operator guide (client-scoped roles via `ClaimProfile`), SCIM provisioning guide, and webhooks guide.

### Changed

- **Authorization engine** — replaced Zanzibar/relationship-tuple engine with claims-based RBAC; permissions are now embedded in JWTs at issuance time rather than checked at request time.
- **License** — promoted to AGPL-3.0-only (`LICENSE`) for OpenSSF machine-detectability; commercial licensing available (see `docs/vision/VISION.md`).
- **Admin handler organization** — split `admin.rs` (~10 000 lines) into seven per-entity submodules for maintainability.
- **OIDC `iss` claim source** — now reads from `config.oidc.issuer` (not `config.token.issuer`) so the ID token issuer always matches the discovery document (OIDC Core §2 compliance).
- **Storage `put_batch` API** — all multi-record writes (user import, audit chain) go through a single WAL frame with CRC; a crash mid-batch leaves no partial state on replay.
- **Audit `append`** — refactored to use `put_batch` (primary record + actor index + action index in one WAL record), eliminating dangling index entries on crash.

### Fixed

- Double-slash 404s on Admin Users workspace links (HEA-306).
- `/jwks` endpoint cold-start timeout in CI OIDC HTTP flow test (HEA-276).
- `PUT → PATCH` on `/admin/users/{id}` to conform to RFC 7396 partial-update semantics.
- SCIM `ServiceProviderConfig` endpoint missing auth enforcement.
- Lettre CVE via cargo-audit remediation (HEA-304).
- Stale Tailwind `app.css` CI failure after template changes.
- CodeQL and Scorecard scanning alerts across protocol and identity layers (HEA-294).
- Various `clippy::pedantic` violations gating the new CI quality-gate workflow (HEA-276).

### Security

- **PKCE mandatory** — all public clients must supply a `code_challenge`; server rejects authorization requests without one (Security Phase A).
- **Redirect URI exact-match** — registered redirect URIs compared byte-for-byte; no prefix or wildcard matching (Security Phase A).
- **RFC 9207 `iss` parameter** — returned in every authorization response to prevent mix-up attacks (Security Phase A).
- **Fuzz harnesses** — `cargo-fuzz` targets for token exchange and redirect URI parsing added to `fuzz/` (HEA-503).
- **OIDC nonce replay protection** — TTL-based eviction on the in-memory nonce set prevents unbounded growth while preserving replay resistance.
- **Ed25519-only JWT signing** — `alg:none` and symmetric algorithms (HS256 etc.) rejected at decode time.
- **Argon2id password hashing** — OWASP-recommended parameters; off hot path via `spawn_blocking`.
- **Zeroize-on-drop for secrets** — passwords, tokens, and keys wrapped in `Zeroize`-on-drop types; `Debug`/`Display`/`Serialize` impls intentionally absent.
- **Constant-time comparisons** — all secret-equality checks use `subtle::ConstantTimeEq`.
- **Audience claim validation** — `aud` checked against configured allowed audiences per RFC 7519 §4.1.3 (HEA-239).
- **`exp` and `token_type` enforcement** — `validate_token` rejects expired and mis-typed tokens (HEA-129).
- **HTTP body size limits** — enforced at protocol layer to prevent memory-exhaustion attacks.
- **Error sanitization** — error messages scrubbed of sensitive data before crossing layer boundaries.

### Removed

- **Zanzibar authorization engine** — `src/authz/`, tuple storage, `AuthzCache` in TypeScript and Go SDKs, `POST /v1/authz/check`, `GET /v1/me/capabilities`, and `CapabilityPage` bundles. All authorization now goes through `src/rbac/`.
- **`lazy_static`** — replaced with `std::sync::OnceLock` / `LazyLock` throughout.
